        <p>A restaurant (sometimes known as a diner) is a place where cooked food is sold to the public, and where people sit down to eat it. It is also a place where people go to enjoy the time and to eat a meal. Some restaurants are a chain, meaning that there are restaurants which have the same name and serve the same food.</p>
